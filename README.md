# Mini-LSM Step-by-Step Guide

This repo contains checkpoints of solutions for each of the chapters in the [mini-lsm](https://github.com/skyzh/mini-lsm) tutorial. Each commit of this repo is a checkpoint of a solution corresponding to a chapter.

Keeping such checkpoint repo up-to-date to the mini-lsm tutorial is hard because each bug fix or new feature will need to go through all commits (or checkpoints). Therefore, this repo might not be using the latest starter code or incorporating the latest features from the mini-lsm tutorial.

**TL;DR: We do not guarantee this repo contains a correct solution, passes all tests, or has the correct doc comments.** For a correct implementation and the solution after implementing all things, please take a look at the solution in the main repo instead. https://github.com/skyzh/mini-lsm/tree/main/mini-lsm

## How to use this solution?

If you are stuck at some part of the tutorial or do not know where to implement a functionality, you can refer to this repo for help. You may compare the diff between commits to know what has been changed. Some functions in the mini-lsm tutorial might be changed multiple times throughout the chapters, and you can know what exactly are expected to be implemented for each chapter in this repo.

## Contribution

All bug fixes should go to the mini-lsm main repo at https://github.com/skyzh/mini-lsm/. We will periodically apply patches from the main repo to this checkpoint repo.
